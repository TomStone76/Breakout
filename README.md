# Breakout

This is a version of the Breakout game from the MDN Gamedev Canvas tutorial/workshop (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript). The JavaScript uses the code from MDN with some modifications. I incorporate my own customized CSS to improve the appearance of the game.
